A Chinese gambling game,a set of 32 Chinese dominoes. 
The top double-row of tiles lists the eleven matching pairs, in descending value from left to right. 
Below them are five non-matching pairs, worth less than the matching pairs, and also in descending value from left to right. 
The Gee Joon tiles, lower right, are the highest pair of all.

## Rules

### Starting


Tiles are randomized on the table and are stacked into eight stacks of four tiles each in an assembly known as the woodpile. Various ritualistic "shuffles" are made, rearranging the tiles in the woodpile in standard ways that result in a new woodpile. Bets are then made.

Next, each player (including the dealer) are given four tiles with which to make two hands of two tiles each. The hand with the lower value is called the front hand, and the hand with the higher value is called the rear hand. 

- If a player's front hand beats the dealer's front hand, and the player's rear hand beats the dealer's rear hand, then that player wins the bet. 

- If a player's front and rear hands both lose to the dealer's respective hands, the player loses the bet.

- If one hand wins and the other loses, the player is said to push, and gets back only the money he or she bet. Generally seven players will play, and each player's hands are compared only against the dealer's hands.
